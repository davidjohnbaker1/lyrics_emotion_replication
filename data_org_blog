=============================================

Only one type of data in each folder! 

Blog Post 
  Spent a lot of time with data scientists
  One thing part of training is RDBMS
  Big name here is SQL
  They live data, so some things are unsaid
  That said, had to figure this out hard way in PhD
  Going to do walk through of how I organised data for OSF
  Obvious for some, not for others
  Jenny Bryan Resources 
  
  No universal way to keep data, that said some better than others
  But not intunitive and like Hadley says, they don't come up by themselves.
  No judgment if your spreadsheets are NOT like this, but hope to convince you otherwise.
  
  What's the problem IMO?
  The way that a human interacts with a spreadsheet is not best way a computer does.
  Imagine taking survey data.
  Wide table here.
  Very OK and makes sense.
  But way compter does this is Long for grouping.
  Terrifying to look at bc as UX can't do stuff we want like marginal averaging.
  Sometimes you want to use spreadsheets for this (projecting your income into next months)
  But with experimental design, want to take as much of a hands off approach as possible.
  Why? Because someone is going to copy and paste something wrong.
  Less we touch the data the better.
  Ideally it just gets piped into this, but not always the case.
  We don't always working with SE.
  
  Data here is awful to look at.
  But it adheres to tidy principles.
  Tidy 1: each variable a column.
  Pretty good for most part, first need to split out that one column (done for ped)
  Tidy 2: Each observation a row.
  Good for most part, but needs to be long not wide 
  Tidy 3: This is one that doesn't get enogh attention. 
  Each table is obervational unit
  In psychology easiest example is data from experiment and demographic.
  We want to keep the two separate not only for data cleanliness, but privacy.
  
  Point here is that expcted to be able to join 
  in example here, going to use a left join.
  Means doing xyz.
  
  Now have long tidy data that is not repeated.
  Remember think this of 10x scale

  lastly, need to save it.
  give it a name that says exactly what it is
  numbers make sure to have leading 00s 
  put both the raw data, script, and saved in clear spot in dir.
